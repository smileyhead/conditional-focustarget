changelog: Initial release.
author: smileyhead
name: Sticky Focus Target
internal_name: StickyFocusTarget
punchline: Like /focustarget, but with no overrides.
description: |-
  "(PvE-only.) Adds the /stickyfocustarget command, which focuses your current
  target, as long as you do not already have a focus target set.
    
  Have you ever felt focusing was under-utilised? Wanted to use it without a
  dedicated keybind? Do you not even know what focus targeting is?
  You've come to the right place.
    
  You can add this command to your Attack Nearest macro and ensure that the
  first enemy you target will become focused, and stay that way, until it dies.
  This way, you can focus enemies without having to consciously press a keybind,
  and ensure that, for example, when a boss spawns an add and you target it,
  your current focus target will NOT get overriden.

  This plugin does not change the behaviour of the stock /focustarget command,
  and must be triggered either manually or by adding it to a macro.
  Placeholders are supported."
