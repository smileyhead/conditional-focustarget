  "Punchline": "Like /focustarget, but with no overrides.",
  "Description": "(PvE-only.)\nAdds the /conditionalfocustarget command (/cft for short), which focuses your current target, but only as long as you do not already have a focus target set (or that target is dead). This command is designed to be included in your stock Attack Nearest macro (or similar).\n\nExample scenario: You are confronted by a boss. You execute your Attack Nearest macro which both targets and focuses the boss. The boss spawns an add, which you target using the same macro, but since you already have a focus on the boss, it stays on the boss and only your regular targeting moves onto the add.",
