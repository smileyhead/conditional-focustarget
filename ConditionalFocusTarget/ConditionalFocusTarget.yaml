changelog: Initial release.
author: smileyhead
name: Conditional Focus Target
internal_name: ConditionalFocusTarget
punchline: Like /focustarget, but with no overrides.
description: |-
  "(PvE-only.)
  Adds the /conditionalfocustarget command (/cft for short), which
  focuses your current target, but only as long as you do not already
  have a focus target set (or that target is dead).

  This plugin does not change the behaviour of the stock /focustarget
  command, and must be triggered either manually or by adding it to a
  macro. The command is designed to be included in your Attack Nearest
  macro (or similar).
  
  Example scenario: You are confronted by a boss. You execute your
  Attack Nearest macro which both targets and focuses the boss. The boss
  spawns an add, which you target using the same macro, but since you
  already have a focus on the boss, it stays on the boss and only your
  regular targeting moves onto the add."
