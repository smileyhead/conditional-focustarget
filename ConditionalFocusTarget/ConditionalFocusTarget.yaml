changelog: Initial release.
author: smileyhead
name: Conditional Focus Target
internal_name: ConditionalFocusTarget
punchline: Like /focustarget, but with no overrides.
description: |-
  "(PvE-only.)
  Adds the /conditionalfocustarget command (/cft for short), which focuses
  your current target, but only as long as you do not already have a
  focus target set (or that target is dead). Arguments are supported.

  This plugin does not change the behaviour of the stock /focustarget command,
  and must be triggered either manually or by adding it to a macro. The
  command is designed to be included in your Attack Nearest macro (or similar)."
